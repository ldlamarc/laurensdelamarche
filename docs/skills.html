  <p>I always try to read and learn about new languages. This is often required by clients too. Hence, this list
    is probably outdated by the time you read it.</p>

    <strong>Machine learning</strong><br />
    I learned the basics during my studies at the University. It was an optional course. We saw and practiced
    among other things the techniques discussed in &quot;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&quot; by
    Christopher M. Bishop.<br />
    These techniques include: Neural networks, Logistic/Linear Regression, Q-learning, Support Vector Machines,
    K-nearest neighbor, Gaussian mixture models, PCA.<br />
    <br />
    In my freetime I read a lot of papers about Machine learning. My main interests are style transfer, Deep
    learning applied to computer vision problems and generative models. I try to keep up with recent
    developments in the community through online reading and watching (papers, discussions, blogs, courses). I
    run my own Deep learning desktop on which I love to experiment. I have experience with the popular research
    frameworks. I also give presentations about machine learning trends and techniques.

    <strong>Soft skills</strong><br />

    Some of my accomplishments requiring soft skills.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Giving presentations about new trends and techniques in software design and machine learning. Writing blog
      articles about Rails or Ruby.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mentoring junior developers at multiple projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participating in several optional entrepreneurial courses and competitions with different ideas.
    </li>
    <li>
      Starting my own tutoring company as a side project to aid both high school and university students
      succeed. The company had four tutors including me.
    </li>
    <li>
      Volunteering as book president in the fraternity of our faculty of Engineering. Hence, my responsibilities
      included the distribution and sales of course materials for the faculty of Engineering in Ghent (~2800
      students). This also involved communication and negotiation with faculty staff and suppliers (achieving
      significant cost reductions)
    </li>
    <li>
      Organizing and supervising a 20 day trip to the USA from Belgium for a group of 9 staying at 12 different
      locations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  I am hence able to aid clients not only in their technological issues but also by giving strategic, pragmatic,
  financial, commercial or even aesthetic advice for their products.

    <strong>Languages</strong><br />
    Dutch(native), English(fluent), Spanish(fluent), French(fluent)<br />
    My master thesis was written in English. My engineering studies were in Dutch. I obtained a French and
    Ecuadorian high school diploma and did one year of &quot;classes pr&eacute;paratoires aux grandes
    &eacute;coles&quot; in France.
