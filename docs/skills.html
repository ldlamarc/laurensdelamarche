  <p>I always try to read and learn new things. This is often required on new projects. Hence, this list
    is probably outdated by the time you read it and focusses more on recent exposure. I consider myself a T profile
    with in-depth knowledge on webapplication development in Rails and a very broad generalist appetite and skillset.

    <strong>Machine learning</strong><br />

    I have always had a passion for machine learning. From following optional courses at the University (prof. dr. ir.
    Benjamin Schrauwen), to following
    online lectures (C231N, Karpathy), to giving presentations to colleagues, to reading various theoretical books,
    studying papers and practical experimenting
    with various frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Lasagne).

    I scored highly on some online competitions and even tried to start a company in the field.

    My passionn never fully grew into a career as I was always very happy as a more generalist software engineer.

    Some presentations I gave about machine learning can be found <a href="/presentations.html">here</a>.

    <strong>Soft skills</strong><br />

    Some of my accomplishments requiring soft skills.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Giving presentations about new trends and techniques in software design and machine learning. Writing blog
      articles about Rails or Ruby.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mentoring junior developers at multiple projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participating in several optional entrepreneurial courses and competitions with different ideas.
    </li>
    <li>
      Starting my own tutoring company as a side project to aid both high school and university students
      succeed. The company had four tutors including me.
    </li>
    <li>
      Volunteering as book president in the fraternity of our faculty of Engineering. Hence, my responsibilities
      included the distribution and sales of course materials for the faculty of Engineering in Ghent (~2800
      students). This also involved communication and negotiation with faculty staff and suppliers (achieving
      significant cost reductions)
    </li>
    <li>
      Organizing and supervising a 20 day trip to the USA from Belgium for a group of 9 staying at 12 different
      locations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  I am hence able to aid clients not only in their technological issues but also by giving strategic, pragmatic,
  financial, commercial or even aesthetic advice for their products.

    My master thesis was written in English. My engineering studies were in Dutch. I obtained a French and
    Ecuadorian high school diploma and did one year of &quot;classes pr&eacute;paratoires aux grandes
    &eacute;coles&quot; in France.
