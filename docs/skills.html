  <p>I always try to read and learn new things. This is often required on new projects. Hence, this list
    is probably outdated by the time you read it and focusses more on recent exposure. I consider myself a T profile
    with in-depth knowledge on webapplication development in Rails and a very broad generalist appetite and skillset.

    <strong>Machine learning</strong><br />

    I have always had a passion for machine learning. From following optional courses at the University (prof. dr. ir.
    Benjamin Schrauwen), to following
    online lectures (C231N, Karpathy), to giving presentations to colleagues, to reading various theoretical books,
    studying papers and practical experimenting
    with various frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Lasagne).

    I participated in online competitions and even tried to start a company in the field.

    My passion never fully grew into a career as I was always very happy as a more generalist software engineer.

    Some presentations I gave about machine learning can be found <a href="/examples.html">here</a>.
