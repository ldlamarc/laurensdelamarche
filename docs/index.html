      My name is Laurens De la Marche. I am currently Staff Engineer (Tech Lead) at <a
        href="https://www.abbove.com">Abbove</a>.
      I graduated as MSc Computer Science Engineering and spent most of my career engineering web appplications using
      mainly Ruby on Rails. The last years I transitioned into a more hands-on leadership role leading the technical
      vision and team.
