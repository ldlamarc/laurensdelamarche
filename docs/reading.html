    <strong>Software Design</strong><br />

    Aa a Rails developer I respect their doctrine of not falling into <a
      href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#no-one-paradigm">one paradigm</a>. So I like reading about all kinds of
    styles. I don't agree with all of them but I like knowing and understanding them well.
