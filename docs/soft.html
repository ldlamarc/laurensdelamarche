  <strong>Soft skills</strong><br />

  Some of my accomplishments requiring soft skills.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Giving presentations about new trends and techniques in software design and machine learning. Writing blog
      articles about Rails or Ruby.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Participating in several optional entrepreneurial courses and competitions with different ideas.
    </li>
    <li>
      Starting my own tutoring company as a side project to aid both high school and university students
      succeed. The company had four tutors including me.
    </li>
    <li>
      Volunteering as book president in the fraternity of our faculty of Engineering. Hence, my responsibilities
      included the distribution and sales of course materials for the faculty of Engineering in Ghent (~2800
      students). This also involved communication and negotiation with faculty staff and suppliers (achieving
      significant cost reductions)
    </li>
    <li>
      Organizing and supervising a 20 day trip to the USA from Belgium for a group of 9 staying at 12 different
      locations.

  I am hence able to aid clients not only in their technological issues but also by giving strategic, pragmatic,
  financial, commercial or even aesthetic advice for their products.
