        Divavenue is a concept for a start-up by three founders including me. I developed the site based on graphical
        PSD designs made by a professional and requirements set out by the two other founders. The site is in Ruby On
        Rails. It connects with a PostgreSQL database, different API&#39;s of services like payment and transport. It
        featured complex models and views. Development was agile and test-driven. I deployed a stage and development
        version of the site. The production site is still in development.

        The Internet Movie Database contains a huge amount of user generated data. In this project we attempt to use
        machine learning techniques on this dataset to predict the scores of movies. This way we create insight in how
        much the director, actors, etc. affect the overall appreciation of a movie by the audience. We compare the
        performance of linear regression on the data with that of single layer neural networks. After training these
        neural networks, some interesting conclusions can be made from the obtained weight matrices.

        LEGO software. The images recorded by the IP-camera were processed in OpenCV in C++ and transformed. Our

        My thesis addresses generic gamification and its possibilities in digital books. I investigated the
        feasibility and usability of a generic gamification framework in EPUB 3. This was done by defining three
        different use cases for digital books and implementing them. Development was done in EPUB 3 (HTML/CSS/JS) to
        create the digital books. Ruby On Rails was used to create a publisher web application. Python was used to
        scrape existing content from the web for the gamified cooking book demo (cooking recipes). DBPedia spotlight
        was used for semantic linking of content.
